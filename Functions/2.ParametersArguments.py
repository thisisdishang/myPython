# Parameters or Arguments?
# The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.
# From a function's perspective:
# A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
# An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called

# Here "name" is parameter we pass in function
def greeting(name):
    print("Good Noon "+name)

# Here "Ola" is argument we give to a function
greeting("Ola")
