# Python has no command for declaring a variable
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

x=2
y="Dishang"
print(x,"\n")
print(y)

# Casting
# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
print(x)
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
print(y)
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
print(z)

# You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
a='Dishang'
b="Rana"

# Variable names are case-sensitive
a="a"
A=45
