# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations
# Operator	Name	        Example
#    +	    Addition	    x + y	
#    -	    Subtraction	    x - y	
#    *	    Multiplication	x * y	
#    /	    Division	    x / y	
#    %	    Modulus	        x % y	
#    **	    Exponentiation	x ** y	
#    //	    Floor division	x // y

# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
# Operator	Example	    Same As
#    =	    x = 5	    x = 5	
#   +=	    x += 3	    x = x + 3	
#   -=	    x -= 3	    x = x - 3	
#   *=	    x *= 3	    x = x * 3	
#   /=	    x /= 3	    x = x / 3	
#   %=	    x %= 3	    x = x % 3	
#   //=	    x //= 3	    x = x // 3	
#   **=	    x **= 3	    x = x ** 3	
#   &=	    x &= 3	    x = x & 3	
#   |=	    x |= 3	    x = x | 3	
#   ^=	    x ^= 3	    x = x ^ 3	
#   >>=	    x >>= 3	    x = x >> 3	
#   <<=	    x <<= 3	    x = x << 3

# Comparison operators are used to compare two values
# Operator	Name	                    Example
#   ==	    Equal	                    x == y	
#   !=	    Not equal	                x != y	
#   >	    Greater than	            x > y	
#   <	    Less than	                x < y	
#   >=	    Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
#   <=	    Less than or equal to	    x <= y

# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statement
# Operator	Description	                                                    Example
#   and 	Returns True if both statements are true	                    x < 5 and x < 10	
#   or	    Returns True if one of the statements is true	                x < 5 or x < 4	
#   not	    Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not     (x < 5 and x < 10)
