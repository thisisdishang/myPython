# Python is an object oriented programming language
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects

# Create a Class:
# To create a class, use the keyword class
class FirstClass:
    # data member or properties
    x=10

# Create Object:
O1=FirstClass()
print(O1.x)

"""The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.
To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function"""
